## General info
This project is simple online classroom web. Since this is a end-of-term project, we are required to organize the source code and files according to the requirements of the project. 
Website will have all the basic functions for a class's activities. We will upgrade it to become a Q&A website, so there may be unused redundancies in the database and resources.
